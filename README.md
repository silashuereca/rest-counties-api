# Country Search
Using A REST API, this project fetches data from [rest countries api](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all) helping provide information about any country across the world. 
## Project Overviev
This [web application](https://youthful-shirley-6664a6.netlify.com) was built using React and react-select. The purpose of this app was to help users quickly find information about any country using a select box(to choose a region a country is in) and using a search field to filter out countries in that region.
